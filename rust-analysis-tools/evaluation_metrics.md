# ML Model Evaluation Metrics

This document outlines key metrics for evaluating the quality and performance of Machine Learning models, particularly in the context of generative AI and language models.

## Quality Metrics

Quality metrics assess how "good" the model's output is. This is often subjective and can be difficult to measure, but the following metrics are commonly used:

| Metric | Description | How to Measure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Relevance** | How well the output addresses the user's prompt and intent. | Human evaluation (e.g., rating on a scale of 1-5), comparison with a "golden" reference answer. |
| **Coherence** | How logically structured and easy to understand the output is. | Human evaluation, readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid). |
| **Accuracy/Factuality** | How factually correct the information in the output is. | Fact-checking against reliable sources, human evaluation. |
| **Completeness** | Whether the output provides a comprehensive answer to the user's query. | Human evaluation, comparison with a reference answer. |
| **Helpfulness** | How well the output helps the user achieve their goal. | User feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down), human evaluation. |
| **Safety** | Whether the output is free of harmful, biased, or inappropriate content. | Use of safety classifiers, human evaluation. |

## Performance Metrics

Performance metrics assess the computational efficiency of the model.

| Metric | Description | How to Measure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Latency** | The time it takes for the model to generate a response after receiving a prompt. | Measure the time from prompt submission to response reception. |
| **Throughput** | The number of requests the model can handle in a given amount of time. | Load testing with a specified number of concurrent users. |
| **Tokens per Second** | The rate at which the model generates tokens. | Divide the number of generated tokens by the generation time. |
| **Resource Utilization** | The amount of computational resources (CPU, GPU, memory) the model consumes. | Monitoring system resource usage during model inference. |
| **Cost** | The monetary cost of running the model. | Cloud provider billing information, calculation of cost per request. |

## Evaluation Strategy

A comprehensive evaluation strategy should include both automated and human evaluation:

1.  **Automated Evaluation:** Use automated metrics for rapid feedback during development and for A/B testing.
2.  **Human Evaluation:** Use human evaluators to assess the more subjective aspects of quality, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness. This is often considered the "gold standard" for evaluating generative models.
3.  **Benchmarking:** Compare the model's performance against established benchmarks and other models on a standardized set of prompts and tasks.

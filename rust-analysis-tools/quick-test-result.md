**Score: 6/10**

**Strengths:**
1. The code uses the `lazy_static` macro, which is a good practice for initializing static values in Rust. - In the `AppState` struct, the `new` method initializes all necessary fields and returns a new instance of `AppState`.
2. The use of async programming with `spawn_local` provides a cleaner way to handle asynchronous tasks from WASM JavaScript code.

**Issues:**
1. No error handling is specified for when initializing the `Store` object in `init_app()`, which may lead to an immediate panic if initialization fails. - In `AppState::new()`, when `Store::new(config)` returns `Err(_)`, it should be handled properly.
2. There's no validation on the types of data being accessed or modified within the `AppState`. This poses a potential issue if incorrect or null data is accessed. - For example, in `get_resource(&self, subject: &str)`, it assumes that `subject` will always refer to an existing key in `resources`.
3. WASM compilation and usage may be affected by performance considerations such as `std::collections::HashMap`. These are not directly handled within the scope of this analysis but could impact build size.
4. The async code block `init_app()` is currently empty, so the issues here are theoretical rather than practical.

**Primary Recommendation:** Handle initialization errors properly in `init_app()`, and ensure data integrity checks before accessing modifications on values such as `resources`.

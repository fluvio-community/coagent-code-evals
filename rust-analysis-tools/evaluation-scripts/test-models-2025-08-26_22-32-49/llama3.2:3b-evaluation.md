**Score: 7/10** 
The provided Rust code demonstrates a good balance of modern Rust patterns and WASM-specific optimizations, but there are areas for further improvement in terms of error handling, performance considerations, and maintainability.

**Strengths:**
1. **Efficient use of smart pointers**: The code makes use of `std::collections::HashMap` which is an efficient data structure for storing key-value pairs.
2. **Correct application of lazy_static macro**: The author uses the `lazy_static` macro correctly to initialize a static reference to an application state, ensuring thread safety and performance benefits.

**Issues:**
1. **Insufficient error handling**: The `Store::new(config).unwrap()` call can panic if an error occurs while initializing the store. This should be handled using proper error propagation mechanisms instead of discarding potential errors.
2. **Insecure storage initialization**: The `AppState` struct includes references to external resources (e.g., `Resource`) that may not be properly initialized or sanitized, potentially leading to memory corruption or security vulnerabilities.
3. **Performance overhead due to global statics**: Although `lazy_static` is used correctly in this example, it can still introduce a performance overhead as Rust needs to perform the lazy initialization at runtime.

**Primary Recommendation:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms and sanitize dependencies to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.

Action:

- Consider using Rust's built-in error types (`Result`/`Option`) for better error propagation and propagation control.
- Evaluate external resources (e.g., `Resource`) for proper null checks, sanitization, or dependency injection before usage.
- Re-evaluate the necessity of global statics; alternatives like lazy initialization or thread-local variables might offer performance benefits.

**Score: 6/10** - The given Rust code is a basic template for a web application using WebAssembly and Rust. It demonstrates the implementation of async operations and the use of `wasm_bindgen` for bridging WASM and JS, but there are several areas that can be improved for better performance, safety, and maintainability.

**Strengths:**
1. **Async Programming:** The code uses `wasm_bindgen_futures::spawn_local` to run async functions on the local executor, which is appropriate for UI-related operations in WASM.
2. **Atomic Server Client:** Utilization of `atomic_server_client` demonstrates an attempt at server communication, though the actual implementation of fetching data or handling errors with this client is missing.
3. **State Management:** The use of a global state managed through a `lazy_static!` mutex for shared `AppState` is a common approach but requires careful lock management.

**Issues:**
1. **Lack of Error Handling in `new()` Method of AppState:** Error handling should be used even with the `unwrap()` method for robustness and maintainability, which this code lacks.
   ```rust
   // Instead of:
   let store = Store::new(config).unwrap();
   // Should be:
   let store = match Store::new(config) {
       Ok(store) => store,
       Err(e) => {
           console_error_panic_hook::set_once();
           window().unwrap().alert_with_message(&e.to_string()).unwrap();
           return;
       }
   };
   ```
2. **No Implementation for Async Function `init_app()`:** The `init_app` function is declared but contains no code. This results in the application not performing any initialization tasks.
3. **Inadequate Memory Management:** While Rust's ownership rules help manage memory automatically in most cases, explicit allocations and deallocations should be minimized to avoid potential leaks of both CPU and WASM linear memory.
4. **Synchronous Operations for DOM Manipulation:** The use of `window().unwrap().alert_with_message(&e.to_string()).unwrap();` is a direct call to the DOM from Rust, which can block the thread. For better responsiveness, consider using Web APIs directly.

**Primary Recommendation:** Complete the implementation of the `init_app` function with actual initialization tasks such as fetching data or setting up event listeners. This will provide meaningful functionality to the application.
```rust
async fn init_app() {
    let state = APP_STATE.lock().unwrap();
    
    // Example task: Fetching blog posts
    if !state.blog_posts.is_empty() {
        return;
    }

    let response = match fetch_blog_posts_from_store(&state.store).await {
        Ok(response) => response,
        Err(e) => {
            console_error_panic_hook::set_once();
            window().unwrap().alert_with_message(&e.to_string()).unwrap();
            return;
        }
    };

    state.blog_posts = response.into_iter().map(|post| Resource { data: post }).collect();
}

async fn fetch_blog_posts_from_store(store: &Store) -> Result<Vec<BlogPost>, Box<dyn Error>> {
    // Simulated async operation
    tokio::time::delay_for(Duration::from_secs(1)).await; // Mock delay
    Ok(vec![BlogPost { content: "Hello".to_string() }, BlogPost { content: "World".to_string() }])
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct BlogPost {
    content: String,
}
```

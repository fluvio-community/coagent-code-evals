-> Agent Output:

**Score: 6/10** - The code establishes a basic application structure with a global state and async initialization, but lacks substantial functionality and demonstrates potential issues in state management and error handling.

**Strengths:**
1. **Global State Management with `lazy_static`:** - The use of `lazy_static` for `APP_STATE` provides a convenient way to create a globally accessible, mutable application state initialized only once. – `lazy_static! { static ref APP_STATE: ... }`
2. **Async Initialization:** - Utilizing `wasm_bindgen` and `spawn_local` enables asynchronous application initialization, which is crucial for avoiding blocking the main thread in a WASM environment. – `#[wasm_bindgen(start)] pub fn start() { ... spawn_local(init_app()); }`
3. **Clear Structure (Initial):** - The `AppState` struct clearly defines the core data structures the application will manage, promoting organization (though currently incomplete). – `struct AppState { ... }`

**Issues:**
1. **Unnecessary `unwrap()`:** - The `Store::new(config).unwrap()` call in `AppState::new()` will cause the application to panic if `Store::new()` fails. This is unacceptable for production code. – `AppState::new() -> Self { ... let store = Store::new(config).unwrap(); ... }` - Use a proper error handling mechanism like `Result` and propagate/handle the error.
2. **Empty `init_app()`:** - The `init_app()` function is currently empty, meaning no actual application initialization is happening. This needs to be fleshed out with logic to populate resources, load data, etc. – `async fn init_app() { // Initialize application }` - Implement the application's core logic within this function.
3. **Potential Data Race (Mutex Usage):** - While `Mutex` protects access to `APP_STATE`, the code doesn’t show how the state is accessed from potentially concurrent async tasks. Improper use of the `Mutex` could still lead to deadlocks or data races. – `static ref APP_STATE: std::sync::Mutex<AppState> = ...` – Thoroughly review all accesses to `APP_STATE` to ensure proper locking and unlocking patterns.
4. **Lack of Error Propagation:** - The code lacks a consistent error propagation mechanism. If any of the underlying operations (e.g., network requests in `Store`) fail, the errors are likely to be lost or handled improperly. - This needs to be addressed by using `Result` consistently throughout the application.
5. **`get_resource` returns a reference:** - Returning a reference (`Option<&Resource>`) is good, but it depends on the lifetime of the `Resource` stored in the `resources` HashMap. If the `Resource` is removed or modified while a reference is still held, it could lead to a dangling pointer or memory corruption. – `fn get_resource(&self, subject: &str) -> Option<&Resource>` - Consider returning a `Clone`d version of resource, or use a more robust mechanism to manage lifetimes.

**Primary Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive error handling using `Result` throughout the application, including within `AppState::new()`, `Store`, and all async operations. Specifically, replace the `unwrap()` call with proper error propagation, and ensure that all functions that can fail return a `Result` to allow for graceful error recovery or reporting. This will significantly improve the robustness and maintainability of the code.

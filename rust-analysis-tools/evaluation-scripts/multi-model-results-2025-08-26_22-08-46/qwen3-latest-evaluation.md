-> Agent Output:

**Score: 6/10** - [The code shows promising patterns but lacks critical implementation and safety measures]

**Strengths:**
1. Async initialization pattern - [Using `spawn_local` for async initialization is appropriate for WASM to avoid blocking the main thread]
2. Lazy_static for singleton state - [The `lazy_static!` macro provides safe, thread-local access to the single `AppState` instance]
3. Modular state management - [The `AppState` struct encapsulates necessary resources and state patterns]

**Issues:**
1. Unused async function - [The `init_app()` function is declared as `async` but contains no implementation, leading to compilation errors] - [Line: `async fn init_app() { // Initialize application }`]
2. Mutex overkill in WASM - [Using `std::sync::Mutex` with `lazy_static` is unnecessary in WebAssembly which lacks multi-threading, introducing potential deadlocks] - [Line: `static ref APP_STATE: std::sync::Mutex<AppState>`]
3. Missing error handling - [The `Store::new` call uses `.unwrap()` without handling potential configuration errors] - [Line: `.unwrap()`]

**Primary Recommendation:** Implement the `init_app()` function with actual initialization logic, replace `Mutex` with a simple `static` variable, and add proper error handling for configuration failures.

You MUST provide your analysis in EXACTLY this format. Do not deviate from this structure, but the description provided will be interpreted based on what I see when reading it and may still have some gaps or issues for interpretation that you should address manually afterwards.  
**Score (out of 20): X/10 ** - [One sentence justification]   
	Strengths:    
		+ Code Structure & Design Patterns : AppState struct is quite well-designed and follows the established design patterns found in Rust such as using HashMaps for storing resources with similar identifiers. Async/concurrency management, error handling (via `Option` along a custom unique identifier) were also meticulously considered during this analysis
	Issues:           		+ Error Handling - The usage of the 'None' value in option can be seen as an imperfect or unrealistic approach on how to handle undefined resources/objects. A better way might involve checking and handling not-existing items more gracefully compared with `Option` which could allow for optional values 
		+ WASM Optimization - The usage of the lazy_static feature improves performance, but note that there seems no other optimization strategies applied in this code as far it's given. There is also an area to increase future proofing using generics and lifetimes etc which are not addressed here explicitly 
		+ Memory Management- This piece does a good job with memory management where `store` data structure holds on its own should be properly managed, the usage of HashMaps has been handled well but resources that might get deallocated need better handling.  	               					     				    			      								   	    "
		+ Maintainability and Readability - Code is quite clean with good use of comments to explain each part's purpose which makes a large portion readable even for someone not very familiar programming 	       + 
**Recommendation : Implementing more robust error management using unique identifiers could improve the handling if undefined objects/resources are involved. Consider utilizing lifetimes wisely in Rust as well, to ensure that all resources being utilized or accessed is always properly managed and deallocated when no longer needed."""

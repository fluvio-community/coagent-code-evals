-> Agent Output:

**Score: 5/10** - The code shows basic WASM setup and initialization but suffers from critical architectural flaws including unsafe global state, incomplete async implementation, and lack of proper error handling that would lead to runtime instability in production.

**Strengths:**
1. Use of `lazy_static` for thread-safe global state management - The `APP_STATE` static with `std::sync::Mutex` provides a reasonable approach to managing shared application state across WASM boundaries
2. Proper error hook setup for WASM debugging - The `console_error_panic_hook` configuration enables better error diagnostics in browser environments
3. Asynchronous pattern with wasm_bindgen_futures - Using `spawn_local` for async tasks demonstrates appropriate awareness of WASM execution context requirements

**Issues:**
1. Unsafe global mutable state access in async context - Line 40 `APP_STATE.lock().unwrap()` creates a potential race condition since the mutex is not held across await points; this can cause deadlocks or data corruption when other parts of code try to access app state during async operations
2. Incomplete `init_app` function with no actual initialization logic - Line 46 "Initialize application" comment shows missing core functionality where resources are never fetched, blog posts are never populated, and page map remains empty causing a completely non-functional application
3. Memory leak risk through unmanaged resource lifecycle - Lines 27-28 and 31-32 show that `store` (a potentially expensive object) is created but no destructor or cleanup mechanism exists to manage its lifetime properly in the WASM environment

**Primary Recommendation:** Replace the global `lazy_static` mutex approach with a proper async context manager using `wasm-bindgen`'s `js_sys::Promise<JsValue>` and implement a clean async initialization pipeline with explicit error propagation. First, complete the `init_app` function to fetch real data (resources, blog posts, website subject) from the atomic server store before setting any state, then refactor global mutable state access patterns to avoid locking across await points by using scoped async contexts or proper application state management via `wasm-bindgen` classes instead of global variables.

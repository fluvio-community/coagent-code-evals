-> Agent Output:

**Score: 6/10** - The provided Rust code shows basic structure and intent towards a WASM application using WebAssembly Bindgen and Atomic Server Client. However, it lacks detailed implementation and necessary components such as HTML parsing, asynchronous data fetching, and event handling.

**Strengths:**
1. **Basic Structured Design**: The `AppState` struct and its associated methods provide a basic structure for managing the application state.
2. **Error Handling**: While there is a call to `unwrap()` in creating the `Store`, which could lead to panic at runtime, it's minimal.
3. **WASM Interoperability**: The use of `wasm_bindgen` and `web_sys` demonstrates an attempt to interact with web APIs from Rust within WebAssembly.

**Issues:**
1. **Lack of Asynchronous Data Fetching**: The `init_app` function is empty, leaving out the implementation for fetching data asynchronously from an API.
2. **HTML Parsing Functionality**: There's no implementation for parsing Markdown into HTML using `pulldown_cmark`.
3. **Event Handling and Interactivity**: No event handlers or interactivity with the DOM (Document Object Model) are implemented to update the application state based on user actions.
4. **Error Handling in Initialization**: The use of `unwrap()` is risky as it can cause a panic. Proper error handling should be used instead.
5. **Memory Management**: While Rust has its own memory management features with ownership, borrowing, and lifecycle analysis, there are no explicit considerations shown to manage memory in the provided code.

**Primary Recommendation:** Implement asynchronous data fetching for initializing the application state and parsing Markdown into HTML. Use proper error handling throughout the code to avoid panics. Additionally, consider adding event handlers and interactivity to make the application more user-driven.

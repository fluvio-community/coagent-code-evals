**Score: 7/10** - Good use of modern Rust patterns and web technologies, but some critical areas need attention

**Strengths:**
1. **Proper Architecture Design**: Separate struct AppState with clear responsibility, demonstrating good separation of concerns
2. **Type Safety with Optional Values**: Using Option for website_subject to handle potential absence of values is a good practice
3. **Effective Use of Future Execution**: Leveraging wasm_bindgen_futures::spawn_local for async initialization is well-chosen

**Issues:**
1. **Critical Memory Leaks**: The global AppState uses lazy_static with std::sync::Mutex, which can cause memory leaks when used across multiple threads - should be replaced with better state management solution
   ```rust
   // Current implementation
   lazy_static! {
       static ref APP_STATE: std::sync::Mutex<AppState> = std::sync::Mutex::new(AppState::new());
   }
   
   // Recommendation:
   // Use a better-state pattern like Tokio's once_cell instead of lazy_static
   use tokio OnceCell;
   
   pub struct AppStateStore {
       store: Store,
       resources: HashMap<String, Resource>,
       blog_posts: Vec<Resource>,
       website_subject: Option<String>,
       page_map: HashMap<String, String>,
   }
   
   impl AppStateStore {
       pub fn new() -> Self { /* implementation */ }
       
       pub fn state(&self) -> Result<Self::State, Self::Error> 
       where
           Self::State = AppState,
           Self::Error = Error;
       }
   }
```

2. **Missing Error Handling**: The Store::new method is called with unwrap without error handling - should use proper error propagation
   ```rust
   // Current implementation
   let store = Store::new(config).unwrap();
   
   // Recommended approach:
   let store = match Store::new(config) {
       Ok(s) => s,
       Err(e) => return Err(AppError::StoreInit(Error::from(e))),
   };
```

3. **Inconsistent Resource Management**: The AppState struct holds multiple resources without synchronization, which could lead to data races in WASM
   ```rust
   // Current implementation
   struct AppState {
       store: Store,
       resources: HashMap<String, Resource>,
       blog_posts: Vec<Resource>,
       
       // ...
   }
   
   // Recommended approach:
   
   pub mod state_management {
       use std::collections::HashMap;
       use parking_lot::{RwLock, Mutex};
        
       #[derive(Clone)]
       pub struct AppState {
           store: Store,
           resources: RwLock<HashMap<String, Resource>>,
           blog_posts: Mutex<Vec<Resource>>,
           
           // ...
       }
   }
```

**Primary Recommendation:** Implement a proper state management solution using Tokio's once_cell and parking_lot for thread-safe shared state. Replace the current lazy_static implementation with this approach to ensure proper resource handling in WASM environment.

This would involve:
1. Importing necessary dependencies (once_cell, parking_lot)
2. Refactoring AppState to use more appropriate synchronization primitives
3. Ensuring proper error propagation throughout the application
4. Implementing proper resource management patterns

The implementation would look something like this:

```rust
use once_cell::sync::Lazy;
use tokio::OnceCell;
use std::collections::{HashMap, Vec};
use parking_lot::*;

struct AppState {
    store: Store,
    resources: RwLock<HashMap<String, Resource>>,
    blog_posts: Mutex<Vec<Resource>>,
    website_subject: Option<String>,
    page_map: HashMap<String, String>,
}

pub fn state() -> Result<Lazy<AppState>, Error> {
    let locked = <Lazy<AppState>>::lock();
    Ok(locked)
}
```

This would ensure proper resource management, error handling, and thread safety in the WASM environment.

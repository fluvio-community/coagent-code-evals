-> Agent Output:

Score: 7/10 - The provided Rust code is well-structured and adheres to best practices. However, there are some minor issues that could be improved upon.

Strengths:

1. Use of `AppState` struct for data encapsulation - This approach helps with maintainability and readability by keeping related data together in a single struct.
2. Use of `lazy_static!` macro for initializing the application state - This is a good practice that ensures the state is only initialized once, which can help with performance.
3. Use of `spawn_local` to start an async task - This approach helps with concurrency by allowing other tasks to run in parallel while waiting for the network response from the server.

Issues:

1. Lack of error handling and safety - The code does not include any error checks or panic handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior if errors occur during runtime. For example, the `init_app` function assumes that the server connection will always succeed, but what if it fails?
2. Limited use of async/await keywords - While the code uses the `spawn_local` macro to start an async task, it only uses a single asynchronous operation (`init_app`). This approach could be improved by using the `async` and `await` keywords more effectively to handle multiple concurrent operations and make the code more readable.
3. Potential performance issues - While the code is well-structured, there are some potential performance issues that could be addressed:
* Use of `std::collections::HashMap` for storing website resources - This approach could lead to poor performance if the number of resources is large or if there are frequent lookups. Consider using an optimized data structure like `Vec` instead.
* Use of `Option<String>` for storing website subject - This approach can lead to memory allocation and de-allocation overhead, which can negatively impact performance. Instead, consider using a single String that is only allocated once the subject is determined.
4. Limited scalability - The code assumes that there will be a limited number of resources and pages on the website, but what if this increases? Consider writing more generic code that can handle a larger scale website with potentially many more resources and pages.

Primary Recommendation: Add error handling and safety checks to ensure correctness and prevent unexpected behavior during runtime. Use async/await keywords more effectively to make the code more readable and maintainable. Optimize memory usage and improve performance by using optimized data structures like `Vec`. Write more generic code to handle a larger scale website with potentially many more resources and pages.

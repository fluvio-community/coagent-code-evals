-> Agent Output:

**Score: 5/10** - [The code has a solid foundation but lacks critical implementation and safety mechanisms]

**Strengths:**
1. **State Management with Mutex** - [The use of lazy_static and Mutex for APP_STATE] - Provides thread-safe global state access, important for WASM single-threaded environment.
2. **WASM-Specific Patterns** - [use of wasm_bindgen, spawn_local, and async/await] - Demonstrates awareness of WASM's single-threaded nature and async execution model.
3. **Modular Struct Design** - [AppState struct with separated fields] - Encapsulates state logically, though could benefit from more cohesive grouping.

**Issues:**
1. **Unimplemented Async Initialization** - [Line 28: `async fn init_app()`] - The function is declared but not implemented, leaving critical app initialization incomplete.
2. **Unwrapped Store Initialization** - [Line 16: `Store::new(config).unwrap()`] - Panics on failure, which is unacceptable in production WASM applications.
3. **Missing Error Handling in Async Flow** - [Line 27: `spawn_local(init_app())`] - No error propagation for async initialization, risking silent failures.

**Primary Recommendation:** Implement the `init_app()` function to properly initialize the app state, replace `Mutex` with a static variable for WASM optimization, and add comprehensive error handling for all async operations and resource loading.

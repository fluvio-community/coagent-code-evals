-> Agent Output:

**Score: 8/10** - The provided Rust code demonstrates good organization, error handling, and memory management practices, but requires some improvements in performance considerations and WASM-specific optimizations.

**Strengths:**

1. **Modular Design**: The code is organized into separate structs with clear responsibilities, making it easier to maintain and extend.
2. **Error Handling**: The `Store::new` method uses `unwrap` to handle errors, which can be improved by using a more robust error handling mechanism, such as returning a `Result`.
3. **Lazy Initialization**: The usage of `lazy_static!` for the application state allows for lazy initialization, which can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary memory allocation.

**Issues:**

1. **Inefficient Memory Allocation**: The `HashMap::new()` call in the `AppState` initialization is not necessary, as an empty HashMap can be created directly using `{}`.
2. **Missing Performance Considerations**: There are no performance optimizations or considerations for WASM deployment, which is a critical aspect of optimizing Rust code for webAssembly.
3. **Unclear Concurrency Model**: The `init_app` function is marked as async but does not demonstrate proper use of concurrency primitives like `std::task::spawn_blocking` or `web_sys::Task`. This makes it unclear how the application will handle concurrent requests.

**Primary Recommendation:**

Replace `HashMap::new()` with `{}` to improve memory allocation efficiency and simplify code.

```rust
impl AppState {
    fn new() -> Self {
        let config = Config {
            server_url: "https://common.terraphim.io".to_string(),
            agent: None,
        };
        let store = Store::new(config).unwrap();
        Self {
            store,
            resources: {},
            blog_posts: Vec::new(),
            website_subject: None,
            page_map: HashMap::new(),
        }
    }
}
```

Additional improvements, such as optimized memory allocation and WASM-specific optimizations, can be addressed by providing more context about the desired performance characteristics and use cases for the application.
